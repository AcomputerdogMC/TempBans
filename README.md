TempBans - A simple bukkit plugin to temporary ban a player
---

TempBans is exactly what it sounds like: a tempban plugin.  It allows you to ban players for a specific amount of time as well as optionally specifying a reason.

WARNING: TempBans has gotten very light testing, so make sure to test all commands before using it on another server.
